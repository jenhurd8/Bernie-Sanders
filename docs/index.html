  <br>
  <p>Bernie Sanders is an energetic politician who has a long history of fighting for the rights of all people.  He started his political activism while at the University of Chicago where he was a member of several human rights groups such as the Young People’s Socialist League, the Civil Rights Movement, Congress for Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He coordinated a sit-in at his university to fight for rights of black students to be able to dorm with white students. He was also active in peace and anti-war movements. </p>
<p>After finishing his degree, he would later become mayor of Burlington, Vermont. He proposed a shopping center development which grew strong support and was supported by many local groups from the police to union professors. He worked hard for the people and would be re-elected three times.  After his run as mayor, he lectured political science at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. </p>
<p>Sanders would then go on to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives from January 3, 1991 – January 3, 2007. He voted in 1996 to try to get rights for federal medical benefits for same-sex workers which failed, but would ultimately pass 17 years later in 2013. He was elected by the state of Vermont eight times to serve in the House of Representatives.  He was known as the “amendment king” in the House of Representatives for passing more amendments than any other member. He then transitioned to his current position as United States Senator for Vermont and would also run for President in 2016 but lost the Democratic Party election to Hilary Clinton. He continues to be a strong proponent against war and prefers to focus on ensuring equal rights for all and building our country's infrastructure. He is also concerned about the environment and regularly challenges our current President Trump’s efforts against such. </p>
